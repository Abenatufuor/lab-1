        My name is Abena Frimpomaa Tufuor and I am an Ashesi University student 
        currently in my 3rd year studying Management information systems.
        I am 20 years of age and a lover of sports but unfortunately I havent 
        engaged in such activities in a while . 
        I am passionate about <strong>making a change in the world
        </strong> 
        and one who believes that once you have breathe you can make an impact . 
        One of my major aims as a student of Ashesi University is to use my knowldege
         <strong>to impact the world at large</strong>, therefore i don't want to just be knowledgeable but 
         I want to be a practioner too.
         Aside all this , i am a <em>lover of God</em> and I love to educate people 
         about the fact that no matter your situation in life you are destined for greatness
        you just have to work towards that vision. For further contact ,
